Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What version of Python are you using?

   Replace with the output of `python --version --version`

2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?

   Replace with the output of `python -c 'import platform; print(platform.platform())'`

3. What are the component versions in the environment (`pip freeze`)?

6. Can you set logging to DEBUG and collect the logs?

   ```
   import logging
   import os
   
   for logger_name in ['snowflake.sqlalchemy', 'snowflake.connector', 'botocore']:
       logger = logging.getLogger(logger_name)
       logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
       ch = logging.StreamHandler()
       ch.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
       ch.setFormatter(logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(threadName)s %(filename)s:%(lineno)d - %(funcName)s() - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'))
       logger.addHandler(ch)
   ```
