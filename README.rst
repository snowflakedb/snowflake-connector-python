This package includes the Snowflake Connector for Python, which conforms to the Python DB API 2.0 specification:
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/

The Snowflake Connector for Python provides an interface for developing Python
applications that can connect to Snowflake and perform all standard operations. It
provides a programming alternative to developing applications in Java or C/C++
using the Snowflake JDBC or ODBC drivers.

The connector has no dependencies on JDBC or ODBC.
It can be installed using ``pip`` on Linux, Mac OSX, and Windows platforms
where Python 3.6.0 (or higher) is installed.
