# YICHUAN: This class simply overrides aiohttp.TCPConnector to perform certificate revocation checks via OCSP after the
# TLS handshake is completed with the server, and before any data is exchanged
# Note that normally, OCSP checks are done DURING the TLS handshake, before the client exchanges its key; there are a
# few concerns this may raise, but currently the Python Connector does OCSP checks after the TLS handshake already

# In ssl_wrap_socket.ssl_wrap_socket_with_ocsp, we invoke SFOCSP using "ret = ssl_.ssl_wrap_socket(*args, **kwargs)",
# at which point ssl_.ssl_wrap_socket has already completed the TLS handshake, so really we're doing the same thing

# https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html#ssl.create_default_context
