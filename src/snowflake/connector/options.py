It implements MissingOptionalDependency as a base class. If a module is unavailable an instance of this will be
returned. These derived classes can be seen in this file pre-defined. The point of these classes is that if someone
tries to use pyarrow code then by importing pyarrow from this module if they did pyarrow.xxx then that would raise
a MissingDependencyError.
