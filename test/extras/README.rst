Extra tests that should run separately
********************************************************************************

Running tests
================================================================================

These tests, just like the other are supposed to run in ``tox``.

Run only these tests with Python 3.6 with this command: ``tox -e py36-extras`` from the top directory.

These tests are run under subprocesses to guarantee them running in new Python processes.
