This package includes the Snowflake Connector for Python, which conforms to the [Python DB API 2.0](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/) specification.

The Snowflake Connector for Python provides an interface for developing Python
applications that can connect to Snowflake and perform all standard operations. It
provides a programming alternative to developing applications in Java or C/C++
using the Snowflake JDBC or ODBC drivers.

The connector has **no** dependencies on JDBC or ODBC.
It can be installed using ``pip`` on Linux, Mac OSX, and Windows platforms
where Python 3.8.0 (or higher) is installed.

Snowflake Documentation is available at:

## How to build

### Locally

Install Python 3.8.0 or higher. Clone the Snowflake Connector for Python repository, then run the following commands
to create a wheel package using PEP-517 build:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-python.git
cd snowflake-connector-python
python -m pip install -U pip setuptools wheel build
python -m build --wheel .
```

Find the `snowflake_connector_python*.whl` package in the `./dist` directory.

### In Docker
Or use our Dockerized build script `ci/build_docker.sh` and find the built wheel files in `dist/repaired_wheels`.

Note: `ci/build_docker.sh` can be used to compile only certain versions, like this: `ci/build_docker.sh "3.8 3.9"`

## Code hygiene and other utilities
These tools are integrated into `tox` to allow us to easily set them up universally on any computer.

* **fix_lint**: Runs `pre-commit` to check for a bunch of lint issues. This can be installed to run upon each
  time a commit is created locally, keep an eye out for the hint that this environment prints upon succeeding.
* **coverage**: Runs `coverage.py` to combine generated coverage data files. Useful when multiple categories were run
  and we would like to have an overall coverage data file created for them.
* **flake8**: (Deprecated) Similar to `fix_lint`, but only runs `flake8` checks.
